# Submission Format of System's Output

The submission format of system's output for the Summarization task should include three columns separated by a tab.

- `First column`: the source document;
- `Second column`: the reference summary;
- `Third column`: the system-generated summary;

The ROUGE scores of the submitted outputs will be automatically computed. 

For CNN/DM and XSum datasets, the re-ranking scores of the outputs from the re-ranking model will also be computed.
