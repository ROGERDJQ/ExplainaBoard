# Submission Format of System's Output

The system's output for the POS-tagging task includes three columns separated by a tab.

- `First column`: token;
- `Second column`: the true tag for a token;
- `Third column`: the predicted tag for a token;

`Note`: The system's output file should have the sentence boundary like the original testing set.
